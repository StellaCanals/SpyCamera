    <h1> What is a SpyCamera‚ùì </h1>
    <p>üì∑ A hidden camera, also called a "spy camera", is a photo or video camera used to film people without their knowledge. The camera is "hidden" since it is either not visible to the subject being filmed, or it is camouflaged in the shape of another object. Hidden cameras have become popular for home surveillance, and can be incorporated into common household items, such as smoke detectors , alarm clocks , plants, or cell phones . Hidden cameras can also be used commercially or industrially as security cameras . Since 2018 the spy cameras in Spain1 have become popular due to the Spy USB.üì∏ </p> </div>
